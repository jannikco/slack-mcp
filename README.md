# Slack MCP setup and connection checker

Generate Slack MCP client configuration, inspect available tools and validate hosted endpoint access through PipMCP.

Maintainer: jannikco · License: MIT · Verification: **mock-only**

## Quick start

Requires Node.js 22 or later.

```sh
npm ci
npm test
npm start
```

The default example runs locally without credentials and makes no external changes. Verification status describes recorded evidence; local configuration tests do not establish that provider authentication or execution works.

## Connect slack

[Create or sign in to PipMCP](https://pipmcp.com/register?app=slack&utm_source=github&utm_campaign=github-slack-mcp) and select the integration. Connect your authorized provider account and copy its hosted MCP endpoint. Set PIPMCP_ENDPOINT and, if required, PIPMCP_TOKEN in your environment. Run npm start to produce client configuration; run npm start -- --live for a read-only connection check. Provider app presence is catalog evidence, not live verification.
